We used Matlab version 9.9.0.1467703 (R2020b), we did not test if this code works with other Matlab versions.

./build/
  In this folder it is placed all the automatically generated files that simulate the multiscale model.

./figs/
  In this folder we save all the figures created with generateFigs.

./model/
  In this folder we placed the definition of the multiscale model using OneModel syntax (for more information see https://github.com/sb2cl/OneModel)

./OneModel/
  Copy of the version of OneModel we used to simulate and define the multiscale model.

./tex/
  In this folder we save all the tex files autogenerated for the paper.

./utils/
  In this folder we placed all the auxiliary functions we needed to do the simulations.

./figure_X.m 
  These scripts create the figures of the paper.

./generateFigs.m
  This script calls all the figure scripts.

./generateTex.m
  This script generates all the tex files of the paper.

./optimizeWildType.m
  This script optimizes the wild type model to fit the experimental data.

./initialize.m
  This scripts initializes the paths for the project to work.

./simulateMassDistribution.m
  This scripts check the result of the wild type optimization.

./simulateModel.m
  This scripts allows us to simulate the multiscale model.
